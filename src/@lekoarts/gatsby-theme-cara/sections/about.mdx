## About

> A lifetime learner of perfecting problem-solving skills. From helping patients to working with technologies, I’m always dedicated to identifying the core issues and fixing them. I am now a Full Stack software engineer and I am eager to learn and work with all of the latest technologies. I can adapt to any environment. As an individual, I am a hard worker. As a team member, I’m an active collaborator. When I am not debugging you can find me talking about sports and keeping up with my favorite mangas.
